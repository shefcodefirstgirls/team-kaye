        Hi guys!
        <br> I got the chance to visit Switzerland in September 2017
          and thought it would be wonderful to tell you about some of the places
          I visited along the way!

          Leg One - The Obergoms
        </div>
        <div class="ParagraphText">
          After collecting our hire car from the airport we drove to a litle
          village located in the canton of Valais. Our first destination
          was Oberwald, a small village located in Obergoms. This is a
          beautiful village full of traditional Swiss housing. One house
          even had cows in a pasture at the front fo the house!
        </div>
          <div class="ParagraphSubHeader">
            Food
          </div>
          <div class="ParagraphText">
            The first night we went to eat at a small resturant which was
            part of a hotel in the area called the Hotel Alphenhof. Their
            Mushroom schnitzel is to diiiiie for!
            The rest of the time we bought food from a local 'Volg' which
            is a little convinience store. This was the mot cost effective
            way of eating.

            Accomodation
          </div>
          <div class="ParagraphText">
            We stayed at the 'Sport and Holiday Camp'. The rooms were in big
            huts which were raised from the ground. Each block had 6 twin rooms
            Four shared bathrooms and a shared kitchen/diner.

          <div class="ParagraphText">
            Glaciers - There are a number of glaciers you can visit, two
            of which I was able to get to!
            <ol>
              <li>Griesgletscher is a glacier with a hydroelectic dam at its
              terminus. You can park in a small car park off of the
              Nufenenstrasse and walk 40 minutes to the dam. From there there
              are a number of walking trails which boared the Italian/Swiss
              border. You can actually walk between the two in one day! </li>
              <li> Rhone Gletscher is another glacier which is further along the
              Furkastrasse. There are actually two ways of accessing the
              glacier. One is to pay at the Belvedere Rhonegletscher which
              will get you access directly to the terminus of the glacier.
              The second option is to park further up the road and there is
              a trail which will tak you up above the glacier, giving you a
              great view for free! </li>
            </ol>
            Whilst visiting Rhone why not go and take a look at the
            ParcplatzHotel Glacieer du Rhone Museum. They have some great
            images of the local area.
            <br>If you stay in the Obergoms area there are hundreds of walking,
            hiking and cycling routes which will keep anyone busy, from beginner
            to the advtanced hiker. I'm not a particularly fit person but
            managed to walk to some pretty amazing views!
            <br>If you decide to go for a hike along the Rotentalhorn glacial
            hike trail (on the Siwss and Italian boarder) then I'd suggest
            nipping in for a drink, or even a nights stay, at Crono Gries. its
            a little hotel situated about 40 mintes walk from Grieslgetscher.
            The views are beautiful and you couldn't get a more peaceful spot.

          Leg Two - Zermatt
        </div>
        <div class="ParagraphText">
          After three nights stay in Obergoms we decided to head towards
          Zermatt.

          Accomodation
        </div>
        <div class="ParagraphText">
          Due the cost of living in Switzerland being so high, you are
          best staying in hostels as these are the cheapest types of
          accomodation available. We stayed in the 'Zermatt' hostel. The staff
          were lovely and it even had its own bar!

        <div class="ParagraphSubHeader">
          Food

        <div class="ParagraphText">
          There are plenty of places to eat in Zermatt, all pricey, but all
          worth it!
          There is a cute little british pub which do snacks! Lovely bit of
          'home away from home'.
          We also ate at an Italian resturant next to the tain station which did
          the best calzone I have EVER had. Period.

          You cannot go to Switzerland and not sample the many ... many pubs
          available. We even found a group of Scotish musicians in one. You
          never know what you might find!

          Leg Three - The Fluhalp
        </div>
        <div class="ParagraphText">
          Having enjoyed a cozy three days in costly Zermatt, the three of
          us decided it was time to move on to 'higher ground. We took the train
          up toward our final destination of the trip, The FLuhalp. This is a
          little hotel based in the mountains. after a super cool train journey
          through (yes ... through!!) the mountain and two cable cars, we were at
          about 2,000 meters above sea level! We were lucky enough to catch a ride
          because of the amount of fieldwork equipment we had, however you usually
          enjoy a 2 hour hike before finally coming across the Fluhalp.

          We stayed at The FLuhalp which is about 2,600 meters above sea level!

          This is a hikers paradise. With incredible views of the Matterhorn
          there are a fair few glacial trails to follow. We only went to
          Findelengletscher as this was where we were conducting out fieldwork,
          however, I will be back to complete some of the other walks!

          Am afraid there are not Volgs at 2,600 meters above sea level, so
          you don't have alot of choice for food. Lucky the Fluhalp provide 3
          square meals a day!

          Well, thanks for giving my blog a read! If you made it this far ... you
          deserve a big gold star!! Switzerland is just amazing and I honestly
          hope you get a change to experience it first hand!
